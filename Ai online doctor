AI online doctor
Building AI course project

Summary
AI doctor is can help the patients from computer screen no need to come to hospital and wait for long time to meet the doctor. AI could help many people at the same time.

Background
Every day many people have to go to hospital. There are a lot of patients need help but waiting for long time is annoying specially if there is a little child running here and there. This issue is something naturally. For me this topic is important because their always people need a special care such as elder people will feel exhaustion from this every time, they need to go to hospital so, I just want to help them with this idea.

How is it used?
My solution would be used in home by using the computer and take a check with AI doctor (online) this well save time and less the exhaustion. This will help the patients to feel more comfortable, especially if they are buzzy and donâ€™t want to west their time in the hospital.

Data sources and AI methods 
Data is collecting from real life. As a person need to visit hospital a lot in my childhood, I know this information. 

Challenges 
The solution does not could help with difficult cases such as a patient need to have a surgery.

What next?
My project can grow up by the help of government and a lot of experience on AI to develop the idea.
